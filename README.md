A few tools to manipulate files and images for NFTs

This is a set of script used to generate Everdragons2 metadata, manipulate the original SVGs to generate the final PNGs in the needed variants, etc.

You can use this code setting your own DNA csv and the other parameters. However the code has not been written to be easily used and it will required many changes to work.
