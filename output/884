{"description":"Everdragons2 Genesis is a collection of 1000 dragons randomly generated from hundreds of assets. They inherit the legacy of Everdragons, minted in 2018 as the first bridgeable cross-chain non-fungible token (NFT)  for gaming. In the marvelous upcoming Origins, the play-to-earn game of the Everdragons Metaverse, holders of Everdragons2 will get a Loot Box containing Obsidian (the Origins token), Settlement Plans, and Genesis Units based on rarity.","image":"https://img.everdragons2.com/assets/animation3.gif","name":"Everdragons2 Genesis Egg #884","attributes":[]}
